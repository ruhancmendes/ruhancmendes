<h2> Hi, I'm Ruhan Mendes ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

I hold a degree in Communication and Journalism, with experience in content production and strategic communication. Currently, I am transitioning my career toward Full-Stack Development with React and Node.js.

I chose this path because I see web development as a dynamic and innovative field where I can apply my creativity and analytical skills to build technological solutions. ðŸš€
